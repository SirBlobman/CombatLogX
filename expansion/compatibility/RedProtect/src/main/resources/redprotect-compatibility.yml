# Default RedProtect Compatibility Config
# Made by SirBlobman

no-entry:
  # How should CombatLogX prevent players from entering 'pvp: deny' or 'mob-combat: deny' regions?
  # KNOCKBACK - Add some opposite velocity to the player so they are pushed backwards
  # CANCEL - Cancel the player's move event
  # NOTHING - Don't do anything, just let them in
  # VULNERABLE - Let the player in, but remove their pvp protection
  # KILL - Set the player's health to 0
  # TELEPORT - Teleport the player to their enemy if they have one, or CANCEL if they don't have one.
  #
  # Default: KNOCKBACK
  mode: KNOCKBACK

  # How much should we multiply the velocity value if the 'mode' is KNOCKBACK?
  #
  # Default: 1.5
  knockback-strength: 1.5

  # How long should we wait before "no entry" messages (in seconds)
  #
  # Default: 30
  message-cooldown: 30

force-field:
  # Even if this option is 'true', you still need to install ProtocolLib
  # ProtocolLib can be found here: https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/1997/
  enabled: true

  # For 1.13+, use the correct material name
  # for 1.8 and below, use the format 'material<:data>'
  material: GLASS
  # material: STAINED_GLASS:14

  # What radius around the player should we check for forcefield areas
  # Smaller values cause less lag but may allow players into the region
  radius: 5

  # What permission is needed to bypass the force field glass?
  bypass-permission: "combatlogx.bypass.redprotect.force.field"

  # Should CombatLogX run the force-field async. This is unsafe but may result in much better performance. Use at own risk!
