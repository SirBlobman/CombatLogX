# Rewards Configuration

rewards:
  # 'reward1' is the ID for this reward
  # You can use letters and numbers (A-Z, a-z, and 0-9) for the id, but no symbols
  # You can have as many as you want but the ids should all be different
  reward1:
    # What is the chance of this reward being executed
    # Chance is a percent value calculated by <chance>/<max-chance>
    # So if you set chance to 5 and max-chance to 1000, the chance will be 5/1000 or 0.005%
    chance: 5
    max-chance: 1000
